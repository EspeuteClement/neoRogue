# neoRogue (working title)
## A retro-modern rogue Like build with LÖVE

Hello and welcome to my small project :)

neoRogue is a game project that aims to be a Rogue Like game
with a retro aesthetic (ASCII graphic and terminal like display).
But there is also a more modern twist, like mouse driven input and
smooth scrolling and displacement. The goal is to have a more user
friendly experience than with the majority of 'classic' rogue likes
that uses only keyboard controls in the terminal.

## Run and install the game (The game is not playable yet)
You'll need LÖVE in order to play the game. 
To run the game, just run 'love src' in the project root directory

Alternatively, you can execute 'make' (you'll need 'zip') in the 
root and then launch the 'neoRogue.love' in the 'out/' folder.
